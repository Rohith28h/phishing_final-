        <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
        <p>
            Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers disguise themselves as trustworthy entities to steal 
            sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, or other personal data. 
            These attacks often come in the form of emails, messages, or websites that appear legitimate but are 
            actually fraudulent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Phishing websites often mimic legitimate sites, making them difficult to identify without proper tools. 
            Our phishing detector uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze URLs and identify potential 
            phishing attempts before you visit them.

        <h2>Our Technology</h2>
        <p>
            The Phishing URL Detector uses a combination of three powerful machine learning models to analyze URLs:

                <h3>Random Forest</h3>
                <p>
                    A versatile ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training. 
                    It's effective at identifying complex patterns in URL structures that may indicate phishing.

                <h3>Support Vector Machine</h3>
                <p>
                    A supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification. Our SVM model is trained to 
                    distinguish between legitimate and phishing URLs based on various features.

                <h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
                <p>
                    A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. 
                    It helps identify specific features that are most indicative of phishing attempts.

        <ul class="safety-tips">
            <li>
                <strong>Check URLs before clicking:</strong> Use our tool to verify suspicious links before visiting them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Look for HTTPS:</strong> Secure websites use HTTPS and display a padlock icon in the address bar.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Be wary of shortened URLs:</strong> URL shorteners can hide malicious destinations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Don't trust unsolicited emails:</strong> Be skeptical of unexpected emails asking for personal information.
